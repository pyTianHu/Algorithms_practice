DFS search algorithm:
Select a maze from the matrixes file, replace its name in the dfs.py file.
Select the start and end points. Remember the matrix uses 0 for 1st row and col just as indexes, so a 6x6 matrix will eventually count from 0-5 on both i and j values.
You may add new matrixes to the matrixes file, and try them, but dont forget to import them.
You can add obstacles anywhere by replacing "." fields with "#".

More to come.
